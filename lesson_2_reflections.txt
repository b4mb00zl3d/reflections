What happens when you initialize a respository? Why do you need to do it? 
It initializes an empty Git repository. You need to do it so you can start doing version control. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an interim stage that holds the files ahead of them being commited to the repository. It's valuable because it allows you to set the files aside before commiting to the repository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
I can use the staging area to track logical changes on before I commit. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful in keeping the history organized if there were several different versions of the existing program. This allows for experimentation before committing entirely. 

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
I think this is pretty obvious. The diagrams give an intuitive visual to understand how the branches are connected to each other and to help the developer understand the consequences of making any further changes and/or commits.
